# iCade.js

This is exactly what it sounds like: a JavaScript library for building games for [the iCade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICade).  I got one for Christmas and thought it would be fun to mess with.  This library creates a huge canvas (1024x1366 on my iPad) and provides an API for reading the iCade's controls.
